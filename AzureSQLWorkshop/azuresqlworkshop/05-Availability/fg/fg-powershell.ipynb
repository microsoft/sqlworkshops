In an enterprise environment, your \"VM\" will likely be a set of resources that make up some type of application. In the event of a failover of your database, you may want to failover your application/VMs/other resources to that new region as well. Both sets of resources will need access to the resources/servers/databases in the other region. In order to do this, you can use virtual network peering, virtual network to virtual network connections, or potentially something else (like ExpressRoute). It will depend on your scenario.
