    "In this course you'll cover the basics of the R language and environment from a Data Professional's perspective. While you will learn the basics of R itself, you'll quickly cover topics that have a lot more depth available. In each section you'll get more references to go deeper, which you should follow up on. Also watch for links within the text - click on each one to explore that topic.\n",

    "There are many \"distributions\" of R. The most common installation is from the CRAN - the Comprehensive R Network. The distribution you will use in this course is installed when you install SQL Server 2016 or higher with ML Services (or R Services in the earlier versions) is called Microsoft R Open (MRO), and its base code is from the CRAN distribution. MRO replaces a couple of libraries (more about those later) and adds a few to increase the speed, capabilities and features of standard CRAN R. \n",

    "\n",
    "- The Interactive Interpreter (Type `R` if it is in your path)\n",
    "- Writing code and running it in some graphical environment (Such as VSCode, Visual Studio, RGUI, R-Studio, etc.)\n",
    "- Calling an `.R` script file from the `R` command \n",
    "\n",
    "When you're in command-mode, you'll see that the code works more like a scripting language. Programming-mode looks like a standard programming language environment - you'll normally use that within an Integrated Programming Environment (IDE). In any case, R is an \"interpreted\" language, meaning you write code that R then runs through a series of steps before it returns a result."
