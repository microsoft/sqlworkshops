No Out-of-Scope Releases. Do not add code with features or functionality that is outside the scope of the Microsoft code approved for released by the OSS request approval. If you are unclear as to the scope of the approval, please contact LCA.

In addition, the following items must be removed from the Microsoft OSS: (a) trademarks and trademarked images; (b) developer names; (c) dependencies on external webpages or databases that may break or become inaccessible; and (d) Microsoft product icons (icons should be self-authored).
